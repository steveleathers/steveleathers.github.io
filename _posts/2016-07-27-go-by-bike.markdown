title: Go By Bike(town)
---

At first, when BIKETOWN started rolling out stations all over town, I was dubious. I like the idea of more bikes on the street, and I'm not particularly offended by BIKETOWN's loud branding. But I couldn't really think of a reason to _use_ BIKETOWN.  

That is, until I found by chain started slipping of my bike just about every time I used it. I took my bike in to be serviced, only to find that I'd need a new chainring, chain, and cassette. It would be about a week.  

I'm lucky enough to live in a very walkable neighborhood. Basically anything I need is less than a mile from my house, so being bikeless for a week isn't a big deal. But where BIKETOWN really shines is filling in gaps when I would have rather biked than walked, taken the bus, or driven.  

It adds a whole new layer of options for me. Where I would have taken a car to go, or _maybe_ taken the bus (if I were along a 4 or 44 line), I can now hop on a bike without having to wait, get some exercise, and not have to pay quite as much as I would have otherwise.
